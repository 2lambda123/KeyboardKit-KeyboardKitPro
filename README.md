## About KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit][KeyboardKit] helps you build custom keyboard extensions for iOS and iPadOS, using Swift and SwiftUI. It extends the native keyboard APIs and provides you with more functionality than is otherwise available.

KeyboardKit lets you create keyboards that mimic the native iOS keyboards in a few lines of code. These keyboards can be customized to great extent to change input keys, keyboard layout, design, behavior etc.

KeyboardKit Pro extends KeyboardKit with pro features, such as fully localized keyboards and services, autocomplete, dictation, proxy extensions, emoji skintone and version info, additional views etc. It supercharges your keyboard and lets you create localized keyboards in all locales with a few lines of code.

KeyboardKit Pro supports `iOS 14`, `macOS 11`, `tvOS 14` and `watchOS 7`, but the standard distribution is `iOS` only. Please reach out if you need to use KeyboardKit Pro on multiple platforms.
 


## Pricing

KeyboardKit Pro requires a commercial license. Licenses can be purchased from the [website][Website] or from [Gumroad][Gumroad].



## Installation

KeyboardKit Pro can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

```
https://github.com/KeyboardKit/KeyboardKitPro.git
```

Since KeyboardKit Pro installs as a binary, it only has to be added to the main app target.



## Supported Locales

KeyboardKit is localized in 61 keyboard-specific locales ([read more][Localization]):

## Getting started

The online documentation has a [getting-started guide][Getting-Started] that will help you get started with the library.

If you want to setup KeyboardKit Pro without a custom view, you can use `setupPro(withLicenseKey:)`:

```swift
func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    let license = try? setupPro(withLicenseKey: "your-key")
    // Use the license as needed here
}
```

Since KeyboardKit will use a `SystemKeyboard` as its default view, this alternative is nice if you just want to use a `SystemKeyboard` with the pro features that are included with your license.

The controller will call `viewWillSetupKeyboard()` when the keyboard view should be created or updated. You can override this function and customize the default view or set up a completely custom one.

Since KeyboardKit uses plain SwiftUI, you can use any custom SwiftUI view hierarchy as your keyboard view.

To set up KeyboardKit Pro with a custom view, you can use `setupPro(withLicenseKey:licenseConfiguration:view:)`.

For instance, here we replace the autocomplete toolbar in the default system keyboard with a custom toolbar:

```swift
override func viewWillSetupKeyboard() {
    super.viewWillSetupKeyboard()
    try? setupPro(
        withLicenseKey: "LICENSE-KEY",
        licenseConfiguration: { license in
            // Use the license as needed here
        },
        view: { controller in
            VStack(spacing: 0) {
                MyCustomToolbar()
                SystemKeyboard(
                    controller: controller,
                    autocompleteToolbar: .none
                )
            }
        }
    )
}
```

and here we use a completely custom view that requires the app-specific controller type:

```swift
override func viewWillSetupKeyboard() {
    super.viewWillSetupKeyboard()
    try? setupPro(
        withLicenseKey: "LICENSE-KEY",
        licenseConfiguration: { license in
            // Use the license as needed here
        },
        view: { [unowned self] _ in
            MyKeyboardView(controller: self)
        }
    )
}
```

When you use a custom view it's *very important* that it has an `unowned` controller reference:

```swift
struct MyKeyboardView: View {

    @unowned var controller: KeyboardViewController 

    var body: some View {
        ... 
    }
}
```

**IMPORTANT** When you set up a custom view, it's *very* important to use `[unowned self] in`, otherwise the strong `self` reference will cause a memory leak, as well as an `unowned var` within the view! Failing to do so will cause a memory leak.

For more information, please see the [online documentation][Documentation] and [getting-started guide][Getting-Started].



## Documentation

The [online documentation][Documentation] has articles, code examples etc. that let you overview the various parts of the library and understand how they all connect to each other.

The online documentation is currently iOS-specific, which means that some parts will not be available if you run KeyboardKit Pro on other platforms.

 

## Demo Application

The [main project repository][KeyboardKit] has a `Demo` folder with a demo apps that lets you try out different KeyboardKit features.

The demo app has 5 keyboard extensions:

* `English` has a `SystemKeyboard` with the standard, English locale.
* `Unicode` has a `SystemKeyboard` with unicode-based input keys.
* `Custom` has a `SystemKeyboard` with custom keys, layout and appearance.
* `Pro` uses KeyboardKit Pro and has a `SystemKeyboard` with all LRT locales.
* `ProRtl` uses KeyboardKit Pro and has a `SystemKeyboard` with all RTL locales.

Just open and run the demo app, then enable the keyboards you want to try under System Settings. Note that you need to enable full access to try some features, like audio and haptic feedback.
