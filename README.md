## About KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit][KeyboardKit] helps you build custom keyboard extensions with Swift and SwiftUI. It extends the native keyboard APIs and provides you with a lot more functionality than is otherwise available. 

The end result can look something like this...or entirely different:

</p> 

KeyboardKit Pro extends KeyboardKit with pro features, such as localized services, autocomplete services and more views. It requires a [commercial license][Licenses] to be used.



## Supported Platforms

KeyboardKit Pro supports `iOS 13`, `macOS 11`, `tvOS 13` and `watchOS 6`.

Although KeyboardKit Pro builds on all platform, some features are unavailable on some platforms. 



## Installation

KeyboardKit Pro is installed with the Swift Package Manager.

```
https://github.com/KeyboardKit/KeyboardKitPro.git
```

KeyboardKit Pro only needs to be added to the main app target.

`IMPORTANT` From KeyboardKit 6.0, KeyboardKit Pro is standalone. This means that it's no longer a plugin that requires KeyboardKit, but rather a standalone library that contains both the core library as well as Pro features.



## Getting started

Once KeyboardKit Pro is added to your project, you need to obtain a license before you can start using it in your application and keyboard extension.

## Documentation

The KeyboardKit Pro documentation contains extensive information, code examples etc. and makes it easy to overview the various parts of the library.

You can [download][Documentation] the documentation and open it directly in Xcode.
