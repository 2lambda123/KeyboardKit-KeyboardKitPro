## About KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit][KeyboardKit] helps you build custom keyboard extensions for `iOS` and `iPadOS`, using `SwiftUI`. It extends the native APIs to provide you with more functionality and has views and utils to let you mimic native keyboards.

The end result can look something like this...or entirely different:
