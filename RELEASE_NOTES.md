# Release notes

KeyboardKit tries to honor semantic versioning:

* Only remove deprecated code in `major` versions.
* Only deprecate code in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Avoid breaking changes in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Code can be marked as deprecated at any time.

Breaking changes can still occur in minor versions and patches, though, if the alternative is to not be able to release new critical features or fixes.


## Older release notes

Older versions have their release notes listed in the `Release_Notes` folder.



## 7.0

KeyboardKit 7.0 involves a major rewrite that aims to bring more consistency in naming and structure and to streamline the library to make future development easier. It bumps the platform deployment targets to iOS 14, macOS 11, tvOS 14 and watchOS 7 and removes all previously deprecated code and todos.

### Migrating from KeyboardKit 6

Although KeyboardKit 7.0 aims to introduce as few breaking changes as possible, there are some surface level APIs that will change. Some such changes are the removal of many shared instances and how more dependencies have to be passed in as parameters. If you are using the now removed shared instances, simply inject the instance as initializer or function parameter instead. 

KeyboardKit 7.0 makes the `SystemKeyboard` easier to use, where it now adds an autocomplete toolbar by default to make sure that the callouts has enough space, and to reduce the risk of memory leaks that was previously easy to add by accident when you connected the toolbar to the keyboard input controller's autocomplete function. If your keyboard uses a custom autocomplete toolbar, you must pass in `autocompleteToolbar: none` in the system keyboard initializer.

If you have problems upgrading to `7.0`, first try upgrading to `6.9`. It has a lot of deprecations in place to provide guidance. You may still experience breaking changes after that, but they will be fewer.
