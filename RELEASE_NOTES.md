# Release notes

KeyboardKit tries to honor semantic versioning:

* Only remove deprecated code in `major` versions.
* Only deprecate code in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Avoid breaking changes in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Code can be marked as deprecated at any time.

Breaking changes can still occur in minor versions and patches, though, if the alternative is to not be able to release new critical features or fixes.


## Older release notes

Older versions have their release notes listed in the `Release_Notes` folder.



## 7.0

KeyboardKit 7.0 involves a major rewrite of many parts of the library, to get more consistency in how things are named and structured. It aims to streamline the library and to make future development easier.

This version bumps the platform deployment targets to make more types available to more platforms. This bump also lets us remove all `@available` annotations, which makes the code a lot cleaner. The release also removes all previously deprecated code and todos.

### Migrating from KeyboardKit 6

Although this release aims to make as few breaking changes as possible, there are some surface level APIs that change and will require you to adjust your code. One such change is the removal of many shared instances, to reduce coupling within the library.

If you have problems upgrading to `7.0`, first try upgrading to `6.9`. It has a lot of deprecations in place to provide guidance. You may still experience breaking changes after that, but they will be fewer.
