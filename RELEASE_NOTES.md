# Release notes

KeyboardKit tries to honor semantic versioning:

* Deprecations can happen at any time.
* Deprecated code will only be removed in `major` versions.
* Breaking changes should not happen in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Breaking changes can still occur in minor versions and BETA features, if the alternative is to not be able to release new critical features or fixes.

These release notes will only contain the current version. Just check out an older branch or version tag to access older release notes. 



## 8.0

Welcome to KeyboardKit 8.0 - a massive update to the KeyboardKit SDK.

KeyboardKit 8.0 is all about cleaning up the library to make it more approachable, better structured and easier to use. It removes all previously deprecated code, reorganizes types into namespaces, and removes low-value utilities, including types solely used for DocC exposure.

Central types like `SystemKeyboard` are now easier to use. Passing state and services instead of a controller reduces the risk for memory leaks. It also no longer needs you to provide a width, but will take up as much space as it needs. It also makes it a easier to provide customize its views.

These updates will simplify scaling the library and has helped enabling new features like fading the keyboard buttons while moving the cursor with space. There are many quality of life and bug fixes. Accessibility has been drastically improved for Voice Over and the emoji keyboard has been redesigned.

Most emoji features, including the emoji keyboard and emoji category information, are now Pro features. The `SystemKeyboard` automatically removes the emoji key if no custom emoji keyboard is provided in the view builder.

The documentation has been extensively updated to provide more information and code examples. Please report any inconsistencies found, as much is rewritten.

I hope that you will love this major update to KeyboardKit.
