# Release Notes

KeyboardKit tries to honor semantic versioning:

* Only remove deprecated code in `major` versions.
* Only deprecate code in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Avoid breaking changes in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Code can be marked as deprecated at any time.

Breaking changes can still occur in minor versions and patches, though, if the alternative is to not be able to release new critical features or fixes.


## Planned changes for 7.0

Some things that are planned for the 7.0 release:

* Removing the keyboard action `tap` gesture and only use `press` and `release`.
* Rewriting the system keyboard gestures to support swipe to type and predictive type.

## 6.6

This version adds a brand new gesture engine, which aims to make typing feel a lot more like in the native keyboards.

This version also adds new emoji capabilities, such as a unicode id and name, as well as support for skin tone variants (Pro feature). These new capabilities are used by the emoji keyboards, which can now show input callouts and skin tone variants when you type on an emoji keyboard.   


### How to disable the new button gesture engine

Since typing is such an important part of this library, the new gesture engine can be toggled off if you find problems with it:

```
FeatureToggle.shared.toggleFeature(.newButtonGestureEngine, .off)
```

Note that the new gesture engine is only available in iOS 14+. Devices running iOS 13 will still get the current gesture engine, even if you toggle on this feature.

These versions add more licenses to KeyboardKit Pro. 



## 6.5

This version adjusts the KeyboardKit Pro license model. 

There are some minor breaking changes in KeyboardKit Pro that should be straightforward to fix.

### üëë KeyboardKit Pro

* The `UITextDocumentProxy` full text content extensions have been tweaked to perform better.

## 6.4.3

This release is built for Xcode 14 and Swift 5.7. Use the `6.4.3_xcode13` tag if you need support for Xcode 13, Swift 5.6 and Bitcode.

This caused uploads to App Store generate warnings. Rolling back this change will make uploads work again, without warnings.

If you want to customize the display name for a keyboard locale, you have to do so manually in your app.

There are also new layout utilities that make adjusting keyboard locales a lot easier, and a bunch of struct properties have been converted from `let` to `var` as well, to make them mutable.

The demos have been adjusted as well. There's also a brand new demo keyboard that shows how to customize the layout.
